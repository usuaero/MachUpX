# Input Files
The basic input file for MachUp contains a JSON object which describes the scene and which aircraft are in the scene, along with the state of those aircraft in the scene. A separate JSON object is used to specify the geometry and controls of each aircraft. These aircraft objects can reference other files that store information on airfoil properties, chord distributions, sweep, etc., as will be discussed. At a minimum, two JSON objects will be created by the user, a scene object and an aircraft object.

## JSON Format
The basic structure of a JSON object is a set of key-value pairs, analogous to a Python dictionary. Examples can be found in the examples/ directory. The following sections describe the structure of the JSON objects used to interface with MachUp. Only one JSON object is specified per .json file. When using the JSON objects, only the scene object is passed to MachUp. As long as the paths to all other JSON objects are properly specified in the scene object, MachUp will automatically load all other required objects.

## Units
MachUp allows the user to specify the units for each value if they desire. For float values, this is done by making the value a list where the first element is the actual value and the second element is a string specifying the units. For example:

    "area" : [6.75, "ft^2"]

For vector inputs, such as position and velocity, the units are simply appended to the vector:

    "velocity" : [100.0, 13.0, 0.0, "ft/s"]

For array inputs, such as a density profile or chord distribution, the units are appended as another row in the array:

    "rho" : [[0.0, 1.225],
             [2000.0, 1.0066],
             [4000.0, 0.81935],
             ["m", "kg/m^3"]]

When specifying column units in files, these are also appended as another row:

    # File: density_profile.csv
    0.0, 1.225,
    2000.0, 1.0066,
    4000.0, 0.81935,
    "m", "kg/m^3"

The following measurements can be defined with the accompanying units:

| Measurement                   | Acceptable Units                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Position/displacement/length: | "ft", "m", "in", "cm"             |
| Area:                         | "ft^2", "m^2"                     |
| Velocity:                     | "ft/s", "m/s", "mph", "kph", "kn" |
| Angular deflection/position:  | "deg", "rad"                      |
| Angular rate:                 | "deg/s", "rad/s"                  |
| Density:                      | "slug/ft^3", "kg/m^3"             |
| Weight/Force:                 | "lbf", "N"                        |
| Moment:                       | "ft lbf", "Nm"                    |
*Note the carat is required in units containing powers. Otherwise, MachUpX will not recognize the unit specification.*

Except for angular measurements, the first unit listed is the default for "English" units. The second is the default for "SI". For angular measurements of state and control deflections, as well as airframe geometry, the default is always degrees. For airfoil parameters, measurements may only be expressed in radians. When specifying units in an array and one of the measurements is dimensionless (e.g. span fraction), "-" should be used. Any results generated by MachUpX will be output in the default unit for the given system, regardless of how units were specified for the inputs.

## Coordinate Systems
Throughout MachUpX, two coordinate systems are used. These are the body-fixed and earth-fixed coordinate systems. In the body-fixed coordinate system, the x-axis points forward out of the nose of the aircraft, the y-axis points to the right along the wing, and the z-axis points down. The body-fixed coordinate system has its origin at the aircraft's center of gravity.

In the earth-fixed coordinate system, the x-axis points North, the y-axis points East, and the z-axis points down. The origin of the earth-fixed coordinate system is somewhat arbitrary, but it is assumed to be at sea level. In this coordinate system, the earth is assumed to be flat.

A 4 column array is a field where the first three columns are the position in earth-fixed coordinates and the fourth column is the density. MachUp will linearly interpolate these data. These arrays can alternatively be stored as a csv file, in which case, this value should be the path to the file. NOTE: Since MachUpX uses earth-fixed coordinates for position, altitude values should be negative (i.e. 1000 ft above sea level would be -1000 ft).

If this is a 4-element vector it is assumed the quaternion formulation is used where the first element is the scalar (i.e. [e0, ex, ey, ez]).

>**"airfoils" : dict**
>>Defines the airfoil section parameters for all airfoils used on the aircraft. Any number of airfoils can be defined for the aircraft. MachUp pulls from these airfoil definitions as needed, depending on which airfoils are specified for the wings. A dictionary defining an airfoil has the following structure:

UNITS MAY NOT BE SPECIFIED BY THE USER FOR ANY AIRFOIL PARAMETERS. THESE VALUES MUST BE SPECIFIED IN THE UNITS GIVEN HERE. If no airfoils are listed here MachUp will automatically generate a default airfoil and use it on all lifting surfaces.

>>>>Gives the GEOMETRIC twist of the wing. If specified as a float, then this is simply the mounting angle of the wing segment and the segment will have no further twist. If specified as an array, the array gives the twist as a function of span. The first column gives the span location as a fraction of the total span. This column must have values going from 0.0 to 1.0. The second column gives the twist at that span location. If specified as a string, this string must contain the path to a csv file containing the twist data formatted in columns, as with the array. For properties as a function of span, MachUp will linearly interpolate intermediate values. Note that this parameter also determines the mounting angle and washout of the wing segment. Defaults to 0.

>>>
>>>**"sweep" : float, array, or string, optional**

>>>
>>>**"airfoil" : string or array, optional**
>>>>Gives the section airfoil(s) of the wing segment. Can be the name of any airfoil defined under "airfoils" in this object. If specified as an array, the array gives the airfoil as a function of span.

>>>>>Specifies how vortex nodes and control points are to be distributed along the wing segment. Can be "linear", "cosine_cluster", or a list of span locations. "linear" will distribute the control points and vortex nodes evenly along the span. "cosine_cluster" will implement traditional cosine clustering, where points are spaced evenly in theta causing them to cluster at the tips of each segment. If this is a list, it must be an ordered list of span locations of length 2N+1 explicitly giving the span fraction location of each vortex node and control point. Should be arranged as ```[node_0_loc, cp_0_loc, node_1_loc, cp_1_loc,..., node_N_loc, cp_N_loc, node_N+1_loc]```. Defaults to "cosine_cluster".

>>>>**"is_sealed" : bool, optional**
>>>>>Whether or not the flap is sealed. Affects how parasitic drag is modelled. Defaults to true.
>>>

>>>>>Determines which control inputs move this control surface. A control surface can be affected by any number of controls.
